## Code of Conduct

We take our Serch community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via [Issues](https://github.com/Serchservice/providerWebApp/issues) and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- To report security vulnerabilities, please use our [Responsible Disclosure Program]() which is monitored by our security team.
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide on freecodecamp blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

## New contributor guide

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or on our [docs site](https://github.com/Serchservice/providerWebApp/wiki/providerWebApp).
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://gist.github.com/james-priest/74188772ef2a6f8d7132d0b9dc065f9c)

    git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```
3. Commit changes to the branch
  ```console
    git commit -m <commit-message>
  ````
4. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
5. Push changes to repo.
